       "‘Growing up, I didn’t see many people like me represented in the creative industries, which made me feel like I was\n",

       "Whilst working at the National Portrait Gallery during the aftermath of 9/11, Hussain was affected by the prejudice\n",

       "\n",
       "The series ‘You Get Me?’, started in 2008, consists of portraits of working-class British Asian men in Nottingham, \n",
       "Birmingham and London, four of which feature in ‘Lives Less Ordinary’. Hussain found his subjects approaching \n",
       "people saw whilst exploring the cities. The series explores ideas of identity, masculinity and community. It aims \n",
       "to confront the psychological damage of the generalisations populated by the media. \n",
       "\n",
       "The works on display are commanding portraits that recall Old Master paintings. In showing the beauty, strength and\n",
       "vulnerability of the subjects, the works engage the viewer to look beyond surface level assumptions.\n",
       "\n",
       "Hussain does not refer to himself as a photographer as he does not wish his works to be seen as documentary but \n",

Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'Code:\\\\n```py\\' sequence ending with \\'```<end_code>\\' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wiki({\\'query\\': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")\\'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'itertools\\', \\'time\\', \\'queue\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'pandas\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'re\\', \\'unicodedata\\', \\'collections\\', \\'math\\', \\'stat\\', \\'random\\']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don\\'t give up! You\\'re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.'}]},\n",

Hussain has said that his experiences living between these two communities led him to struggle to make sense of his mixed British and Pakistani background.\\n\\n‘Growing up, I didn’t see many people like me represented in the creative industries, which made me feel like I was on the outside looking in. However, I’ve come to see my background in a positive light. It has given me a unique perspective...’ \\n\\nWhilst working at the National Portrait Gallery during the aftermath of 9/11, Hussain was affected by the prejudice against Muslim people. Feeling unrepresented and forgotten by the media and art world, he set out to visualise the experiences of British South Asian men with the aim of de-othering them.\\n\\nThe series ‘You Get Me?’, started in 2008, consists of portraits of working-class British Asian men in Nottingham, Birmingham and London, four of which feature in ‘Lives Less Ordinary’. Hussain found his subjects approaching people saw whilst exploring the cities. The series explores ideas of identity, masculinity and community. It aims to confront the psychological damage of the generalisations populated by the media. \\n\\nThe works on display are commanding portraits that recall Old Master paintings. In showing the beauty, strength and vulnerability of the subjects, the works engage the viewer to look beyond surface level assumptions.\\n\\nHussain does not refer to himself as a photographer as he does not wish his works to be seen as documentary but rather as fine art portraiture.\\n\\nThe works from ‘You Get Me?’ will be on display as part of ‘Lives Less Ordinary’ until 20 April. Hussain’s upcoming exhibition ‘What Did You Want To See?’ will open at @ikongallery on 20 March.](https://twotempleplace.org/wp-content/plugins/instagram-feed/img/placeholder.png)](https://www.instagram.com/p/DGiwAjSoQQ1/)\\n\\nBecome a Member\\n---------------\\n\\n### Support us and enjoy exclusive members tours and events.\\n\\n[Find out more](https://twotempleplace.org/get-involved/become-a-member/)\\n\\nCulture and Community\\n---------------------\\n\\n### Find out more about our cultural events and the communities we work with.\\n\\n[Find out more](https://twotempleplace.org/culture-community/)\\n\\nFamily Activity Resources\\n-------------------------\\n\\n### Download our family resources for free craft activities to do from home.\\n\\n[Find out more](https://twotempleplace.org/learning/)\\n\\n[**Where to find us**  \\nTwo Temple Place, London WC2R 3BD](https://goo.gl/maps/j5h7PSwYhvB2)\\n\\n* [Venue Hire](https://twotempleplace.org/venue-hire/)\\n* [Our Suppliers](https://twotempleplace.org/venue-hire/our-suppliers/)\\n* [Pricing, Capacities and Floorplans](https://twotempleplace.org/venue-hire/pricing-capacities-and-floorplans/)\\n\\n* [Culture & Community](https://twotempleplace.org/culture-community/)\\n* [Exhibitions](https://twotempleplace.org/culture-community/exhibitions/)\\n* [Cultural Programme](https://twotempleplace.org/culture-community/cultural-programme/)\\n* [Community Programme](https://twotempleplace.org/culture-community/community-programme/)\\n* [Community Partnerships](https://twotempleplace.org/culture-community/community-partnerships/)\\n* [What\\'s on](https://twotempleplace.org/whats-on/)\\n\\n* [Learning & Participation](https://twotempleplace.org/learning/)\\n* [Plan a Schools’ Visit](https://twotempleplace.org/learning/plan-your-school-visit/)\\n* [Teacher Resource Packs](https://twotempleplace.org/learning/teacher-resource-packs/)\\n* [Community](https://twotempleplace.org/learning/community/)\\n\\n* [Get Involved](https://twotempleplace.org/get-involved/)\\n* [Make a Donation](https://twotempleplace.org/get-involved/donate/)\\n* [Become a Member](https://twotempleplace.org/get-involved/become-a-member/)\\n* [Volunteering](https://twotempleplace.org/get-involved/volunteering/)\\n* [Vacancies](https://twotempleplace.org/get-involved/vacancies/)\\n* [Sign up to our Mailing List](https://twotempleplace.org/get-involved/mailing-list-signup/)\\n\\n* [Visit Us](https://twotempleplace.org/visit-us/)\\n* [Shop](https://shop.twotempleplace.org/)\\n* [Group visits](https://twotempleplace.org/visit-us/group-visits/)\\n* [Accessibility](https://twotempleplace.org/visit-us/accessibility/)\\n\\n* [About us](https://twotempleplace.org/about-us/)\\n* [The Bulldog Trust](https://twotempleplace.org/about-us/the-bulldog-trust/)\\n* [Two Temple Place Team](https://twotempleplace.org/about-us/staff-team/)\\n* [Contact us](https://twotempleplace.org/contact-us/)\\n\\nTwo Temple Place  \\nLondon WC2R 3BD\\n\\nTwo Temple Place is wholly owned by The Bulldog Trust UK registered charity no. 1123081\\n\\nFor enquiries call: [020 7836 3715](tel:02078363715)\\n\\n[![Bulldog Trust logo](https://twotempleplace.org/wp-content/themes/twotempleplace/assets/images/global/bulldog-trust-logo.svg)](http://bulldogtrust.org/)\\n\\n* [Privacy policy](https://twotempleplace.org/privacy-policy/)\\n* [Cookies](https://twotempleplace.org/cookies/)\\n\\nWeb design & development\\n  \\n [Design Culture](https://www.design-culture.co.uk)\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\nVisiting Wellington\\'s Column and Steble Fountain at https://goo.gl/maps/mGsz3DmtXR6pFh6h8\\nContent for Wellington\\'s Column and Steble Fountain:\\nGoogle Maps                                        \\n\\nWhen you have eliminated the **JavaScript**, whatever remains must be an empty page.\\n\\n[Enable JavaScript to see Google Maps.](https://support.google.com/maps/?hl=en&authuser=0&p=no_javascript)\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\nVisiting St George\\'s Hall at https://www.stgeorgeshallliverpool.co.uk/homepage\\nContent for St George\\'s Hall:\\nWelcome to St George\\'s Hall -

It follows Bruce Wayne AKA the masked vigilante Batman in his second year as Gotham’s protector, where he suddenly finds himself pitted against a sadistic serial killer named Riddler. As Batman races against time to stop and identify the Riddler, he finds himself drawn into the city’s corrupt system, which is connected with his own dark past.\\n\\nThus, the billionaire caped crusader must face his demons to defeat the Riddler and serve justice before it’s too late. The grim backdrop of Gotham city creates the perfect canvas for the movie’s layered narrative and characters, thus complementing its pace. Fans worldwide are highly curious to find out about the exciting places where ‘The Batman’ was filmed. Without further delay, here are the answers to everyone’s queries. Let’s begin!\\n\\nThe Batman Filming Locations\\n----------------------------\\n\\n‘The Batman’ was filmed in various parts of England and Scotland, specifically in Liverpool, London, Watford, Bedford, Glasgow, and Shotts. Some portions were also filmed in Illinois, particularly in Chicago. Principal photography for the movie commenced on January 27, 2020, but was abruptly halted on March 14, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\n> [View this post on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/B71zabnJmgT/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)\\n>\\n> [A post shared by Matt Reeves (@mattreevesla)](https://www.instagram.com/p/B71zabnJmgT/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)\\n\\nAfter battling several challenges like the government permits for shooting and the lead actor [Robert Pattinson](https://thecinemaholic.com/best-movies-robert-pattinson-that-prove-he-is-an-underrated-actor/) testing positive for COVID-19, filming resumed on September 17, 2020. All safety protocols were strictly followed, and production finally [wrapped up](https://www.instagram.com/p/CMW_ynVAEHD/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) on March 13, 2021. Now, let’s get a closer look at the filming sites.\\n\\nLiverpool, England\\n------------------\\n\\n‘The Batman’ was filmed in several locations in Liverpool, a vast maritime city in England. Some of the shooting sites include the Royal Liver Building at Pier Head, Anfield Cemetery at 238 Priory Road, and St. George’s Hall, where the Gotham City Hall was recreated. The Gotham General Hospital and the Gotham Central Court House scenes were taped at the Walker Art Gallery and the County Sessions House, respectively. Moreover, the Halloween market scene was lensed near the Wellington Memorial Statue AKA Wellington’s Column.\\n\\n> Fear not Merseyside, RPattz is watching over the city! [#Batman](https://tw\\n..._This content has been truncated to stay below 10000 characters_...\\nere recorded at the Glasgow Necropolis, a Victorian cemetery that lies on a hill east of St. Mungo’s Cathedral. Around 50,000 people have been buried at this site. Glasgow is reputed for its culture, music, and architecture and has been the host of several sports events. Moreover, it has the largest economy in the country. The city has doubled up as a filming site for several movies, such as ‘[1917](https://thecinemaholic.com/where-was-1917-filmed/),’ ‘[Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga](https://thecinemaholic.com/eurovision-song-contest-filming-locations/),’ and ‘[The Princess Switch 3: Romancing the Star](https://thecinemaholic.com/where-was-the-princess-switch-3-romancing-the-star-filmed/)‘\\n\\nHartwood, Scotland\\n------------------\\n\\nThe Gotham orphanage in the movie was recreated in the Hartwood Hospital, a former psychiatric hospital that closed down in the late 90s. It is located in the village of Hartwood near Shotts, a town in the North Lanarkshire area. For the purpose of filming, the production team put up the signboards at the former medical facility that read: as Gotham Renewal Corporation — Investing in our future — Gotham Orphanage. Due to its dilapidated and gritty condition, it served as a perfect filming site for the fictional Orphanage of the City of Gotham.\\n\\nChicago, Illinois\\n-----------------\\n\\nThe exterior scenes and establishing shots of Gotham in ‘The Batman’ were actually taped in Chicago, a bustling city that sits on the shores of Lake Michigan. It is known for its remarkable skyline and architecture that mixes outdoor public art pieces, monuments, and giant skyscrapers. Chicago is historically significant and a major hub of transport, culture, finance, literature, and performing arts.\\n\\n> Chicago has officially become Gotham City once again! Filming starts soon!
